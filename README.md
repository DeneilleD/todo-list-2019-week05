## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I utilized my skills in javaScript, HTML and CSS to create functions, event listeners, conditions and more: the utilization of these allowed me to make a user interactive slot machine game. the use of" if" conditions were heavily used to print and run code as the user either loses or wins money. I the 3 slot assigned a variable to obtain the Math.randomnumer so the game would generate the 3 slots seen above.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned to make global and local variables to use in functions further down in my code. I also learned to change a string value to be that of an integer and back to a string.
